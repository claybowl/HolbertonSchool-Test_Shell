SIMPLE SHELL MAN

NAME
	Simple shell program - hsh
COMPILING
	gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

SYNOPSIS
       $ [command_name] {arguments}

EXECUTING
	./hsh

DESCRIPTION
	Our shell program is an implementation of a command interpreter that executes commands
	that are taken from the standard input. Our shell program is based off of the original,
	and brilliant, UNIX shell written by Ken Thompson.

OPTIONS
	exit - exits the shell.
	env - lists environmental variables.

USAGE
	Our shell has dual usage. It can be used in interactive mode where "$" appears to the
	user to execute a command. This repeats until the end of the hsh process (using exit
	or ctrl + d). There is also a non-interactive mode where it sends the output of a
	command as an input to the ./hsh program using a pipe command.

EXAMPLES
	Interactive mode:
				./hsh
	Non-interactive mode:
				echo "ls" | ./hsh

					- This shows the list of files or directories that
					  you have in your current directory in a 
					  non-interactive way.


EXIT STATUS
	exit or ctrl + d.
