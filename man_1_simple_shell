SIMPLE SHELL MAN

NAME
        Simple shell program - hsh
COMPILING
        gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 *.c -o hsh

SYNOPSIS
       $ [command_name] {arguments}

EXECUTING
        ./hsh

DESCRIPTION
        Our shell program is an implementation of a command interpreter that executes commands
        that are taken from the standard input. Our shell program is based off of the original,
        and brilliant, UNIX shell written by Ken Thompson.

OPTIONS
        exit - exits the shell.
        env - lists environmental variables.

USAGE
        Our shell has dual usage. It can be used in interactive mode where "$" appears to the
        user to execute a command. This repeats until the end of the hsh process (using exit
        or ctrl + d). There is also a non-interactive mode where it sends the output of a
        command as an input to the ./hsh program using a pipe command.

EXAMPLES
        Interactive mode:
                                ./hsh
        Non-interactive mode:
                                echo "ls" | ./hsh

                                        - This shows the list of files or directories that
                                          you have in your current directory in a
                                          non-interactive way.


EXIT STATUS
        exit or ctrl + d.
